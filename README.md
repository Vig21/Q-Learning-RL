# Reinforcement Learning: Q-Learning CartPole Agent 🚀

This repository demonstrates a basic Reinforcement Learning project implementing the Q-Learning algorithm to solve the **CartPole-v1** problem from OpenAI Gym.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
The CartPole problem involves training an agent to balance a pole on a cart by moving it left or right. The agent receives rewards based on how long it successfully keeps the pole balanced.

This project uses Q-Learning, a value-based reinforcement learning technique, which enables the agent to learn optimal actions based on trial-and-error interactions with the environment.
